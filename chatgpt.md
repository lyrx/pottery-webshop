# Guide to Building a Webshop with React.js, Cloudflare Workers, and Durable Objects

## Step 1: Design Your Site

Start with designing your site. Decide what pages you'll need, how they will look, and how they'll interact with each other. Choose and customize a template from HTML5 UP! to match your brand.

## Step 2: Setup React.JS

You will need Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Then, setup your React application with Create React App.

```npx create-react-app pottery-webshop```

## Step 3: Integrate HTML5 UP! template

Converting the HTML5 UP! template into a React app involves converting the HTML and CSS into JSX and CSS modules respectively. You'll have to divide the HTML into components based on the template structure.

## Step 4: Setup Cloudflare Workers

Sign up for a Cloudflare account and install the Wrangler CLI.

```npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler```

Then, generate a new project.

wrangler generate my-worker

## Step 5: Write Your Backend

Start writing your serverless functions on Cloudflare Workers. These will handle things like processing orders, managing inventory, and other back-end tasks. You'll use Cloudflare Durable Objects for managing state in the Workers environment.

## Step 6: Connect React with Cloudflare Workers

Make API calls from your React application to your Cloudflare Workers using the built-in fetch API in JavaScript.

## Step 7: Testing

Thoroughly test your webshop. Use React's testing tools for your application and wrangler dev command for locally testing your Cloudflare Workers.

## Step 8: Deployment

Once you are satisfied with your webshop, deploy it. Use npm run build to create a build directory with a production build of your React app, and use a static site hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages for deployment.

# Step 3: Integrating HTML5 UP! Template into a React Application

## Step 3.1: Choose and Download Your HTML5 UP! Template

Pick a suitable template from HTML5 UP! and download it. Extract the template files to your local machine.

## Step 3.2: Analyze The Template Structure

Open the main HTML file in a text editor. Look for parts of the page that can be turned into reusable React components.

## Step 3.3: Create React Components

Create a new file for each component you've identified in your React app. Convert the HTML for each component into JSX by changing class attributes to className and adjusting the syntax for self-closing tags.

## Step 3.4: Include CSS

If your template has a CSS file, convert it to a CSS module by renaming it from styles.css to styles.module.css, then import it into your component file. You can then use the styles in your component.
```
import styles from './styles.module.css';
<div className={styles.container}>
  {/* Your code here */}
</div>
```

## Step 3.5: Convert Any JavaScript

If the template includes any JavaScript functionality, convert it to React as well. This might involve moving code into useEffect hooks, or converting functions into methods on your component.

## Step 3.6: Repeat

Repeat this process for each component in the HTML template until you've converted the entire template to React.
